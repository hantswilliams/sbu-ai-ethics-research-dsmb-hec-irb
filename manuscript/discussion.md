# Discussion

## Research Objective

Our primary research objective was to evaluate the potential utility and limitations of state-of-the-art generative AI models in providing analysis and recommendations for clinical ethics committee scenarios. We aimed to determine whether these models could competently analyze complex ethical dilemmas in healthcare settings and to identify differences in performance across various models and scenario types. This exploration serves as a foundation for understanding how AI might augment, rather than replace, human decision-making in clinical ethics contexts.

## Summary of Key Findings

All four generative AI models demonstrated competence in analyzing clinical ethics committee scenarios, with average scores above 3.8 on a 5-point scale across all evaluation dimensions. This suggests that current generative AI has reached a threshold of capability that warrants serious consideration for supportive roles in ethics committee processes.

Our statistical analyses revealed significant differences between models in both computational metrics and human evaluations. One-way ANOVA testing confirmed statistically significant differences in processing time (F=55.49, p<0.0001) and response length (F=82.33, p<0.0001) across models. Post-hoc Tukey HSD analyses identified specific pairwise differences, with Anthropic Claude 3 Opus taking significantly longer to generate responses than all other models, and Grok-1 producing significantly longer responses than all competitors.

In terms of human evaluations, ANOVA tests revealed significant differences between models across all evaluation dimensions: relevance (F=6.81, p=0.0002), correctness (F=7.80, p<0.0001), fluency (F=3.45, p=0.0162), coherence (F=4.96, p=0.0020), and overall quality (F=7.07, p=0.0001). Post-hoc analyses consistently showed that Google Gemini 1.5 Pro received significantly lower scores than other models, while differences between Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, Grok-1, and OpenAI GPT-4.1 were generally not statistically significant.

While these statistical differences were significant, the practical differences in performance were modest, with overall scores ranging from 3.82 to 4.10. This indicates that the choice of specific model may be less critical than the decision to incorporate AI assistance in general.

Our correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations between all evaluation dimensions (all r > 0.56, p < 0.001), with the strongest relationships between overall score and coherence (r = 0.875) and between fluency and coherence (r = 0.815). Principal component analysis found that 72.22% of variance in ratings could be explained by a single component, suggesting evaluators tend to perceive AI performance holistically rather than distinguishing sharply between different quality dimensions.

Anthropic Claude 3 Opus demonstrated the longest processing time (mean 32.22 seconds) but performed well in human evaluations, particularly for fluency and coherence. Despite its moderate response length (mean 4,639 characters), it received the second-highest overall evaluation scores, suggesting efficiency in communicating ethical analyses.

Grok-1, despite having the second-longest processing time (mean 15.60 seconds), produced the longest responses by far (mean 10,108 characters) and received the highest overall human evaluation scores (4.10), particularly for relevance and correctness. This challenges assumptions about the relationship between verbosity and quality of ethical analysis.

Gemini 1.5 Pro had a moderate processing time (mean 14.53 seconds) and the shortest responses (mean 3,979 characters), yet received the lowest human evaluation scores across all dimensions (overall mean 3.82), though still performing at a competent level. The statistical analyses confirmed these differences were significant (p<0.001), suggesting fundamental differences in how this model approaches ethical reasoning tasks compared to its competitors.

All models demonstrated strengths and limitations that varied by scenario type, with more consistent performance on end-of-life management (scenario 5, mean 4.15) and cultural scenarios (scenario 1, mean 4.08) compared to more variable performance on reproduction (scenario 4, mean 3.87), addiction (scenario 3, mean 3.92), and self-harm scenarios (scenario 2, mean 3.95). This suggests that certain ethical domains may be better represented in the training data or more amenable to algorithmic analysis.

## Limitations

### Model Limitations

A significant limitation of this study is our inability to fully account for biases present in the training data of the commercial AI models evaluated. These models were trained on large datasets curated by their respective companies, with proprietary filtering, tuning, and alignment procedures that are not fully transparent. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to identify and address potential biases in the ethical analyses generated.

All four models evaluated are closed-source, meaning their weights, exact architectures, and training methodologies are not publicly available. This "black box" nature limits our ability to understand precisely how these models arrive at their ethical analyses and recommendations, reducing interpretability and accountability. Our statistical analyses showing significant differences in processing time (F=55.49, p<0.0001) and response length (F=82.33, p<0.0001) provide some insight into operational differences, but cannot explain the underlying reasoning processes.

We cannot account for potential post-training modifications made to these models, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or other alignment techniques. These modifications may have selectively shaped model outputs in ways that affect their ethical reasoning but are not disclosed by the companies that developed them. The strong correlations we found between evaluation dimensions (all r > 0.56, p < 0.001) may partially reflect these alignment techniques.

Our study was limited to four commercial AI models. While these represent leading generative AI systems, they do not encompass the full range of available models, including open-source alternatives that might allow for greater transparency and customization.

### Methodological Limitations

The five clinical ethics scenarios used in this study, while diverse, cannot represent the full spectrum of ethical dilemmas encountered in healthcare settings. Our statistical analysis showing significant variations in performance across scenario types (with scores ranging from 3.87 to 4.15) suggests that model performance may vary considerably in other ethical contexts not covered by our selected scenarios.

Although our evaluators provided 857 individual assessments across 44 evaluators, the correlation and principal component analyses (showing 72.22% of variance explained by a single component) suggest potential evaluator biases or halo effects in the assessment process. While experienced in healthcare informatics, our evaluators do not have the depth of experience that seasoned clinical ethics committee members possess, which may have affected the evaluation of model outputs, particularly regarding nuanced ethical considerations.

The ANOVA results revealing statistically significant differences between models must be interpreted with caution, as the practical differences in scores were relatively modest (overall scores ranging from 3.82 to 4.10). The statistical significance is partly a function of our large sample size, and may not translate to meaningful differences in real-world applications.

The study evaluated model responses from a single iteration of prompt engineering. In real-world applications, iterative refinement of prompts and follow-up questioning would likely improve model performance and address gaps in initial responses. Our processing time analysis (showing significant variations between models) does not account for the potential need for multiple iterations in practical applications.

Our evaluation provides a snapshot of model capabilities at a specific point in time (July 2025). Generative AI is rapidly evolving, and findings may quickly become outdated as models improve, particularly given the statistically significant differences we observed between current model generations.

## Implications and Future Directions

The findings of this study suggest several promising avenues for future research and practical applications:

### AI as Augmentative Tools for Ethics Committees

Our statistical findings highlight both the capabilities and limitations of current generative AI models in ethical analysis. The consistently high evaluation scores (>3.8/5) across all models suggest these systems could serve valuable augmentative roles in ethics committees, particularly for initial case analysis, identifying relevant ethical principles, and generating structured frameworks for discussion. However, the statistically significant differences between models in processing time, response length, and evaluation scores emphasize the importance of model selection based on specific use cases.

### Leveraging Complementary Model Strengths

The correlation and principal component analyses revealed that evaluators tend to perceive AI performance holistically, with 72.22% of variance explained by a single component. This suggests developing systems that combine the strengths of different AI models with human expertise could maximize benefits while mitigating limitations. For example, using Anthropic Claude 3 Opus for its well-structured analyses and fluency, Grok-1 for relevance and correctness, and human oversight for nuanced cultural and contextual considerations.

### Scenario-Specific Model Selection

Our scenario analysis revealed statistically significant variations in model performance across different ethical contexts. Future research could explore whether models can be fine-tuned for specific types of ethical dilemmas or healthcare contexts, potentially improving performance in areas where current models show weaknesses (particularly reproduction and addiction scenarios, which received the lowest overall scores).

### Transparency and Explainability

The significant differences in processing time and response length did not consistently correlate with higher evaluation scores, highlighting the "black box" nature of these models. Work is needed to develop methods for making AI ethical analyses more transparent and explainable, particularly for high-stakes healthcare decisions. This might include requirements for models to explicitly justify their reasoning by reference to established ethical frameworks.

### Ethical Alignment Techniques

Statistical analyses showing significant differences between models suggest varying approaches to ethical reasoning and potentially different underlying ethical frameworks. Further research into techniques for aligning AI models with human ethical values is critical, especially approaches that can be transparently documented and evaluated.

### Longitudinal Performance Assessment

The statistically significant differences in model performance identified in our study provide a valuable baseline for future comparative work. As AI models continue to evolve, longitudinal studies tracking improvements in ethical reasoning capabilities over time would provide valuable insights into the trajectory of AI development in this domain.

### Efficiency vs. Quality Trade-offs

Our finding that processing time (ANOVA F=55.49, p<0.0001) and response length (ANOVA F=82.33, p<0.0001) varied significantly across models without proportional gains in evaluation scores suggests a need for further research on optimal efficiency-quality trade-offs in AI ethics applications, particularly in time-sensitive clinical contexts.

In conclusion, while current generative AI models demonstrate promising capabilities in analyzing clinical ethics scenarios, significant limitations remain, particularly regarding bias, transparency, and contextual understanding. Our statistical analyses confirm meaningful differences between models that should inform their implementation in clinical ethics settings. These models are best viewed as potential augmentative tools for human ethics committees rather than as replacements for human ethical judgment. Their implementation should be approached with careful consideration of their limitations and with robust mechanisms for human oversight and accountability.
