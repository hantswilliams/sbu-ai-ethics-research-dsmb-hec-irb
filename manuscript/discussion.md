# Discussion

## Research Objective

Our primary research objective was to evaluate the potential utility and limitations of state-of-the-art generative AI models in providing analysis and recommendations for clinical ethics committee scenarios. We aimed to determine whether these models could competently analyze complex ethical dilemmas in healthcare settings and to identify differences in performance across various models and scenario types. This exploration serves as a foundation for understanding how AI might augment, rather than replace, human decision-making in clinical ethics contexts.

## Summary of Key Findings

All four generative AI models demonstrated competence in analyzing clinical ethics committee scenarios, with average scores above 3.8 on a 5-point scale across all evaluation dimensions. This suggests that current generative AI has reached a threshold of capability that warrants serious consideration for supportive roles in ethics committee processes.

While statistically significant differences were found between models, the practical differences in performance were modest, with overall scores ranging from 3.82 to 4.10. This indicates that the choice of specific model may be less critical than the decision to incorporate AI assistance in general.

Claude 3 Opus provided the most comprehensive coverage of ethical principles and performed well in human evaluations, particularly for fluency and coherence. This suggests its potential utility for generating well-structured, thorough ethical analyses.

Grok-1, despite generating the shortest responses and having the second-fastest processing time, received the highest overall human evaluation scores, particularly for relevance and correctness. This challenges assumptions that longer responses necessarily indicate better ethical analysis and highlights the importance of conciseness and relevance.

Gemini 1.5 Pro had the longest processing times and received the lowest human evaluation scores across all dimensions, though still performing at a competent level. The correlation between longer processing times and lower evaluation scores may indicate inefficiencies in how this model approaches ethical reasoning tasks.

All models demonstrated strengths and limitations that varied by scenario type, with more consistent performance on end-of-life and cultural scenarios compared to more variable performance on reproduction, addiction, and self-harm scenarios. This suggests that certain ethical domains may be better represented in the training data or more amenable to algorithmic analysis.

## Limitations

### Model Limitations

A significant limitation of this study is our inability to fully account for biases present in the training data of the commercial AI models evaluated. These models were trained on large datasets curated by their respective companies, with proprietary filtering, tuning, and alignment procedures that are not fully transparent. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to identify and address potential biases in the ethical analyses generated.

All four models evaluated are closed-source, meaning their weights, exact architectures, and training methodologies are not publicly available. This "black box" nature limits our ability to understand precisely how these models arrive at their ethical analyses and recommendations, reducing interpretability and accountability.

We cannot account for potential post-training modifications made to these models, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or other alignment techniques. These modifications may have selectively shaped model outputs in ways that affect their ethical reasoning but are not disclosed by the companies that developed them.

Our study was limited to four commercial AI models. While these represent leading generative AI systems, they do not encompass the full range of available models, including open-source alternatives that might allow for greater transparency and customization.

### Methodological Limitations

The five clinical ethics scenarios used in this study, while diverse, cannot represent the full spectrum of ethical dilemmas encountered in healthcare settings. The scenarios were designed to cover common ethical principles and committee considerations but are necessarily limited in scope.

Although our evaluators were graduate students with relevant backgrounds, they do not have the depth of experience that seasoned clinical ethics committee members possess. This may have affected the evaluation of model outputs, particularly regarding nuanced ethical considerations.

The study evaluated model responses from a single iteration of prompt engineering. In real-world applications, iterative refinement of prompts and follow-up questioning would likely improve model performance and address gaps in initial responses.

Our evaluation provides a snapshot of model capabilities at a specific point in time (July 2025). Generative AI is rapidly evolving, and findings may quickly become outdated as models improve.

While we evaluated the quality of AI-generated responses, we did not directly compare these with analyses from human ethics committee members addressing the same scenarios. Such comparison would provide valuable context for understanding the relative strengths and limitations of AI versus human analysis.

## Implications and Future Directions

The findings of this study suggest several promising avenues for future research and practical applications:

Developing systems that combine the strengths of different AI models with human expertise could maximize the benefits while mitigating the limitations of each. For example, using Claude 3 Opus for comprehensive ethical principle coverage while incorporating human oversight for nuanced cultural and contextual considerations.

Future research could explore whether models can be fine-tuned for specific types of ethical dilemmas or healthcare contexts, potentially improving performance in areas where current models show weaknesses.

Work is needed to develop methods for making AI ethical analyses more transparent and explainable, particularly for high-stakes healthcare decisions. This might include requirements for models to explicitly justify their reasoning by reference to established ethical frameworks.

Further research into techniques for aligning AI models with human ethical values is critical, especially approaches that can be transparently documented and evaluated.

As AI models continue to evolve, longitudinal studies tracking improvements in ethical reasoning capabilities over time would provide valuable insights into the trajectory of AI development in this domain.

In conclusion, while current generative AI models demonstrate promising capabilities in analyzing clinical ethics scenarios, significant limitations remain, particularly regarding bias, transparency, and contextual understanding. These models are best viewed as potential augmentative tools for human ethics committees rather than as replacements for human ethical judgment. Their implementation should be approached with careful consideration of their limitations and with robust mechanisms for human oversight and accountability.
