# Introduction: Evaluating Generative AI for Healthcare Ethics Decision Support

## Background

The emergence of powerful generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude, has sparked significant interest in their potential applications across healthcare domains. These models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and knowledge synthesis that could augment human decision-making in complex scenarios. Of particular interest is their potential role in supporting ethical decision-making processes within healthcare institutions—specifically within ethics oversight bodies such as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Hospital Ethics Committees (HECs), and Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs).

Healthcare ethical decisions frequently involve complex considerations balancing multiple competing principles: patient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. These decisions often occur under time constraints, with incomplete information, and amid evolving clinical circumstances. Traditional approaches to healthcare ethics deliberation, while thorough, can be resource-intensive, inconsistent across institutions, and subject to individual biases and limitations in human cognitive processing.

The integration of generative AI into healthcare ethics frameworks presents a novel opportunity to enhance—not replace—human ethical deliberation through rapid analysis, systematic application of ethical principles, identification of potential blind spots, and standardization of ethical reasoning processes. However, before such integration can be responsibly implemented, rigorous evaluation of these models' capabilities, limitations, and alignment with established ethical frameworks is essential.

## Current Knowledge Gap

Despite growing interest in AI applications for healthcare ethics, systematic evaluations of generative AI models in this domain remain limited. Several knowledge gaps exist:

1. **Performance in realistic scenarios**: Most evaluations of generative AI focus on general reasoning or simplified ethical dilemmas rather than the complex, nuanced scenarios encountered in clinical practice.

2. **Comparative analysis**: Few studies directly compare multiple leading generative AI models using standardized prompts and evaluation criteria specific to healthcare ethics.

3. **Practical application frameworks**: Limited research exists on structured methodologies for effectively integrating AI into existing ethics oversight bodies like IRBs, HECs, and DSMBs.

4. **Proactive monitoring potential**: The concept of continuous, AI-driven ethics and safety monitoring (what we term a Data Safety Monitoring Agent or DSMA) remains largely unexplored.

## Study Objectives

This study aims to address these knowledge gaps through a systematic evaluation of generative AI models in healthcare ethics contexts. Specifically, we seek to:

1. Evaluate the ethical reasoning capabilities of leading generative AI models (OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini) using real-world clinical ethics scenarios derived from documented cases at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

2. Analyze the concordance between AI-generated ethical recommendations and actual clinical ethics committee decisions.

3. Assess response consistency, ethical principle alignment, and reasoning transparency across multiple iterations of standardized prompts.

4. Develop preliminary guidelines for the potential integration of generative AI as a supportive tool within healthcare ethics committees.

5. Explore the conceptual framework for a Data Safety Monitoring Agent (DSMA)—an AI-driven system for continuous ethics and safety monitoring in clinical trials and patient care.

## Significance

This research has potential implications for multiple stakeholders in healthcare ethics:

1. **Ethics committees and IRBs**: Findings may inform how generative AI could augment deliberative processes, improve consistency, and enhance the thoroughness of ethical analyses.

2. **Clinical researchers**: Results could provide insights into novel approaches for continuous ethics monitoring in clinical trials through the DSMA concept.

3. **Healthcare institutions**: Evidence-based guidelines could support responsible implementation of AI ethics tools in organizational workflows.

4. **AI developers**: Identified strengths and limitations may guide future refinements of generative AI models for healthcare ethics applications.

5. **Regulatory bodies**: Findings may inform policy development regarding the appropriate role of AI in formal ethics oversight processes.

By systematically evaluating generative AI in healthcare ethics contexts, this study contributes to the responsible advancement of AI as a supportive tool that enhances—rather than replaces—human ethical judgment in healthcare decision-making.
