The Case
The patient was a middle-aged man with a history of injection drug use who presented with endocarditis, a bacterial infection of the heart valves that is commonly associated with bloodstream infections acquired from injection drug use. The patient was admitted to Brigham and Women’s Hospital and began the first-line intervention for this condition — a prolonged course of antibiotics administered intravenously through a PICC line (peripherally inserted central catheter used to deliver medication directly to a central vein).

After a few weeks in the hospital, the patient was well enough to complete the therapy in a non-acute care setting. The hospital stay had been difficult for him and he wanted to go home. The team was apprehensive about discharging the patient with a PICC line in place. They worried he might be tempted to inject recreational drugs through the PICC portal and contract another infection or suffer a fatal overdose. The nurse director requested an ethics consultation to help address these concerns.
