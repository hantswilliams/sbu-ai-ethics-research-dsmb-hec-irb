The Case
The patient was a middle-aged woman with a complex psychiatric history notable for a severe personality disorder and repetitive foreign-body ingestion (RFBI). She presented to the Brighamâ€™s Emergency Department (ED) after intentionally swallowing a sharp object for which she underwent an endoscopic removal (a minimally invasive procedure in which a telescopic device is introduced through the mouth to locate and extract foreign bodies from the gastrointestinal tract). As she was being wheeled out from the procedure room, the patient grabbed a nearby metal object and swallowed it, necessitating a second procedure right after the first one.

The gastroenterologist who had performed the endoscopy paged the Ethics Service, asking whether it would be ethically permissible to refuse to provide the repeat endoscopy. Given the likelihood that the patient would re-engage in this behavior, he wondered whether yet another intervention would be futile. He also worried about diverting ED resources away from other patients who might have equally or more pressing medical needs.
