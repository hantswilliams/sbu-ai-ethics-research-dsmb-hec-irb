### Study Design: Evaluating Ethical Decision-Making Capabilities of Generative AI for IRB, HEC, DSMB, and DSMA Implementation

#### Background and Rationale
Generative AI models (LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini) demonstrate potential in augmenting ethical decision-making processes in healthcare settings. Existing literature underscores the importance of structured validation and real-world applicability. This study seeks to evaluate generative AI models' ethical reasoning capabilities against real-world clinical ethics cases documented at leading institutions, specifically Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH).

#### Objectives
1. Evaluate ethical reasoning capabilities of generative AI models using real-world ethics scenarios.
2. Analyze concordance between AI-generated recommendations and actual clinical ethics decisions.
3. Develop insights into the practical applicability of AI in hospital ethics committees.

#### Methodology

##### Step 1: Scenario Selection
Eleven real-world clinical ethics case studies will be selected from publicly documented cases at Brigham and Women's Hospital:
- Available at: [Brigham Clinical Ethics Cases](https://bwhclinicalandresearchnews.org/clinical-ethics-case-review/)
- Each scenario involves complex ethical dilemmas spanning end-of-life care, psychiatric emergencies, infectious diseases, organ transplantation, and resource allocation.

##### Step 2: Prompt Development
The following standardized prompt will be applied uniformly to each case scenario:

**Prompt Context:** AI Ethics Advisor as Member of a Hospital Ethics Committee (HEC)

**Role and Identity:**  
You are serving as an AI Ethics Advisor embedded within a Hospital Ethics Committee at a leading academic medical center. Your role is to provide unbiased, ethically rigorous, data-informed analyses and recommendations on clinical decisions, ethical dilemmas, and healthcare policy issues. You complement and support human ethics committee members by providing ethically reasoned guidance.

**AI Responsibilities and Capabilities:**
- Rapid, systematic ethical analyses.
- Clearly articulate ethical principles and tensions.
- Identify ethical blind spots, biases, or overlooked considerations.
- Predict ethical risks or unintended consequences.
- Explicitly provide your clearly stated recommendation for an ethically appropriate clinical decision.

**Ethical Principles Guiding Your Recommendations:**  
Explicitly ground analyses in biomedical ethical principles:
- Autonomy
- Beneficence
- Non-maleficence
- Justice

**Scope and Limitations of AI Decision-making:**
- Clearly indicate scenarios requiring uniquely human judgment.
- Provide explicit, ethically justified recommendations to guide deliberation.
- Maintain transparency, clearly explaining ethical reasoning.

**Structured Format for AI Responses:**  
Responses follow this structure:
1. Brief Clinical Scenario Restatement
2. Identification and Explanation of Relevant Ethical Principles and Tensions
3. Systematic Ethical Analysis
4. Explicitly Stated Recommended Clinical Decisions (Ranked Medical Recommendations):
   - Recommended Decision (Best Medical Option)
   - Alternative Decision (Second-Best Medical Option)
   - Least-Recommended Decision (Third Medical Option)

Responses should be professional, precise, transparent, and actionable.

##### Step 3: AI Model Testing
Selected generative AI models:
- OpenAI ChatGPT
- Google Gemini

Each scenario will be tested multiple times (at least three iterations) to capture response variability, resulting in a minimum of 66 responses (11 cases × 2 models × 3 iterations).

##### Step 4: Data Collection and Analysis
Responses will be systematically captured in Excel, including:
- AI Model Used
- Scenario
- Iteration Number
- Recommended Clinical Decisions
- Ethical Alignment and Justification

A team of student researchers will:
- Review AI responses for concordance and variability.
- Compare AI recommendations against documented real-world clinical ethics committee decisions.
- Utilize thematic analysis to identify strengths, discrepancies, and areas of ethical insight or oversight.

Quantitative metrics:
- Frequency of recommendation concordance with real-world decisions.
- Variability of responses across iterations and models.

Qualitative analysis:
- Thematic insights into ethical reasoning strengths and limitations.

#### Potential Impact and Next Steps
- Empirical evidence supporting the feasibility of integrating AI into hospital ethics committees.
- Development of preliminary guidelines for AI ethics advisory roles.
- Inform future AI ethics tool development and validation.

#### Ethical Considerations
- No real patient data; analysis based on publicly available, anonymized scenarios.
- Explicit framing of AI as a decision support, not replacement for human judgment.
- Transparency regarding AI limitations, variability, and potential biases.
